recipeingredient:
- "2 chicken breast halves boneless and skinless"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter"
- "Handful fresh sage about 2 dozen leaves"
- "450 g dry linguine"
- "1 large shallot finely sliced"
- "1/2 fresh lemon finely grated rind and juice"
- " Freshly grated parmesan for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wrap the chicken breasts in between layers of cling film and use a kitchen mallet, rolling pin, or pot to pound them to an even thickness (aim for about 1 to 1 1/2 cm)."
- "Put a large pan on medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt. Add the sage leaves and let them fry until crisp, about 3 to 5 minutes. Fish out the sage leaves and set them aside."
- "Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and lay them into the pan. Turn the heat up to medium-high and add a splash of olive oil. Sear the chicken, turning over every few minutes, for about 12 minutes, or until a thermometer registers 165 F internal temperature. Remove the breasts to a plate to rest."
- "Drop the pasta into a large pot of boiling, salted water. By the time the noodles are cooked, the sauce should be ready."
- "Add the shallots to the pan you used for the sage. Turn the heat back down to medium and let cook about 5 minutes until the shallots are soft and starting to brown. If they seem to cook too fast, add a ladleful of the pasta cooking water to slow the process down."
- "Carve the chicken into large chunks and return the pieces to the pan. Stir in a few more ladles of pasta water until the sauce emulsifies and thickens. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer gently until the pasta is ready."
- "Drag the cooked noodles into the pan of sauce. Add the lemon rind and a squeeze of juice, then toss to coat. Serve with a sprinkle of parmesan and the crispy sage leaves."
