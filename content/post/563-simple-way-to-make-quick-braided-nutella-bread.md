recipeingredient:
- " For the dough"
- "500 g allpurpose flour"
- "190 ml lukewarm milk"
- "3 tbsp sugar"
- "60 g melted butter"
- "2 eggs"
- "1 lemon of grated zest"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp yeast"
- " For the filling"
- " Nutella"
- " For the glaze"
- "1 tbsp milk  1 tbsp water"
- " For a dusting"
- " Icing sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the yeast and the sugar with the milk. Leave for 10 minutes for the yeast to activate.  Break the eggs into a bowl and beat lightly. Mix the flour, salt and lemon zest in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the butter, eggs and yeast &amp; milk mixture. Mix to a soft dough."
- "Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes then form into a ball and place in a lightly-greased bowl. Cover and leave in a warm place until the dough has about doubled in size."
- "Meanwhile, cut out a greaseproof paper. Place the paper on a baking sheet. Once risen, turn the dough out onto a surface, knock it back knead for 2-3 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and form each piece into a ball."
- "Roll a ball of dough roll out into a circle. The dough should be about 3-4 mm (1/8&#34;) thick. Place the dough onto the greaseproof paper and spread on a layer of Nutella, leaving a small gap at the edge. Don&#39;t make the layer too thick but be sure to evenly cover the dough."
- "Roll out a second ball of dough, place it on the first layer and spread with Nutella. Repeat with the third and fourth balls of dough but do NOT spread Nutella on the final layer.  Cut the brioche into 16 segments but leave a small (3 cm/1½&#34;) area in the centre of the dough uncut (as shown below)."
- "Take a pair of adjacent segments. Lift and twist them away from each other through 180°. Lift and twist through 180° again, then twist through 90° so that the ends are vertical. Press the edges together firmly. Repeat this process for all pairs of segments.  Leave in a warm place for 1-2 hours to prove. Brush with the glaze then bake at 160°C/320°F fan oven, 180°C/360°F conventional oven for 15-20 minutes."
- "Place the bread on a wire rack to cool. Once cooled, dust lightly with icing sugar.  #Notes:  Eat Nutella Brioche. It&#39;s great for breakfast and with a cup of coffee."
- "It you are going to mix the dough in a stand mixer let it run for 3 minutes during the initial kneading and just 1 minute for the second kneading.  If your Nutella is a bit difficult to spread simple place the jar in the microwave for 10-15 seconds with the lid loose, or place in a bath of hot water for 5 minutes."
