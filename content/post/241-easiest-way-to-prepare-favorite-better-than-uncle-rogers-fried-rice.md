recipeingredient:
- "4 cups leftover overnight cooked rice  long grain rice is best for fried rice  Ie bhasmati"
- "1 Chinese sausage optional"
- "4 teaspoons dried shrimp optional"
- "1 medium size onion"
- "5 cloves garlic"
- "1 sprig spring onion"
- " Vegetables of your choice optional  preferably solid ones like root vegetables Im using carrot and also red capsicum Good for adding additional fiber and vitamins to the dish"
- "4 eggs  rule of thumb  1 egg per cup of rice  be generous"
- "1 teaspoon chili flakes optional or you can also use crack pepper"
- " Sauces  4 tablespoon light soy sauce 4 teaspoon fish sauce optional sesame oil optional butter or ghee options"
- " Cooking oil  preferably ones that can have smoke point like vegetable oil or peanut oil"
- " Cooking utensils"
- "1 wok  but if you dont have one a deep frying pan will also do"
- "1 decent spatula"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep all your ingredients - small dice cutting all the vegetables, loosen up the rice, and put all the sauces next to the wok (for easy access when you are stir frying the rice). Pro-tip: add dried shrimp and Chinese sausage to take your fried rice to the next level! To prep in advance, steam the Chinese sausage before removing the skin and dicing it up. As for the dried shrimp, soak it in hot water for 2-3 minutes to remove any salty briney flavour. Drain the shrimp before use."
- "Prep the eggs but beating them up. I usually like to add a dash of milk or water to soften up the eggs. Then heat up your wok. Don’t add any oil until you see the wok smoking up, a.k.a. “Wok-Hey” in the Cantonese dialect. Once, it’s smoking hot, add the cooking oil. Swirl the oil to coat all over the wok."
- "Pro-tip: be a little bit generous with the cooking oil, I used about 6-8 tablespoons of cooking oil. Once the wok is super hot, add in the egg and stir constantly so it doesn’t burn. And when it’s 70%-80% cooked, remove from wok. You should have a super fluffy “omelet” like egg."
- "Once you’ve taken out the fluffy egg, in the same pan add a little bit of sesame oil and throw in your dried shrimp and cook till fragrant (1-2 minutes). Then add in your vegetables (garlic, onion, carrots) with the butter and chili flakes. Cook until the garlic and onion releases its fragrant (1-2 minutes)."
- "Then add in the rice, red capsicum, Chinese sausage and fluffy egg. Continue to stir fry until the rice are loosen and all ingredients are mixed properly. Then add the soy sauce and fish sauce. Don’t forget to taste the food. Remember that the ingredients such as the shrimp, sausage, butter, sauces all have saltiness. Pro-top: Only add salt if it’s not salty enough. Don’t add anymore soy sauce as it may make the fried rice too wet."
- "Finally, add in the spring onion. Give it a final stir before serving it up. The shrimp, Chinese sausage, soy sauce and fish sauce all have a decent umami flavour so you don’t need to add any msg - monosodium glutamate."
