recipeingredient:
- "10 chicken thighs bone in skin on"
- "2 T. Olive oil"
- "2 T. Butter"
- "1 yellow onion diced"
- "1 c. Whiskey"
- "16 oz. BBQ sauce"
- "16 oz. Jar peach preserves"
- "1/2 c. Water"
- "2 T. Worcestershire sauce"
- "4 cloves garlic"
- " Green onions garnishfinish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown thighs in skillet on both sides in the oil and butter. Don&#39;t crowd the pan. Do it in stages. Remove thighs to 10 x 15 lasagna pan. (My 9 x 13 Pyrex was not large enough.)"
- "Once all chicken is seared and in the roasting pan, drain about half the fat out of the skillet and return to the heat. Cook your onions 2 minutes or so, to soften them a bit."
- "Add whiskey to onions. Be careful if you use gas stove. Alcohol is highly flammable. Simmer to let the alcohol burn off and it will reduce just a bit."
- "While that simmers, mix together the remaining ingredients (except green onion). Stir that sauce, preserve, garlic, and water mixture into your boozey onions."
- "Once incorporated, dump this onion sauce on top of your chicken thighs in your roasting pan. (I first tried to fit them in my Pyrex. Took the picture, then changed everything into a bigger pan. Better safe, than sorry.)"
- "Cook at 300 degrees for one and a half hours. Serve with a ladle of sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with green onions. (If you remember them...which, of course, I never do.)"
