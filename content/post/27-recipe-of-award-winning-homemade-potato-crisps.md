recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the potatoes. If the skin is well clean, leave the skins on, if not, take the skin off with a peeler. Then, cut the potatoes in very thin slices with a madolin or a peeler. Season them with salt (at your choice)"
- "Pit the oil in a pan under high heat. When the oil is hot enough, add the potatoes. Depending on the size of the pan, you may need to fry them in 2 parts. When they get a nice colour remove them from the oil and place them on some kitchen roll to absorb the oil."
- "After a 1-2 mins that most of the oil will have been absorbed, season at your choice. I sprinkled some oregano. Instead, you can add some grated gruyere - in this case do not salt the potatoes at all, since the cheese is already salty enough. Enjoy!"
