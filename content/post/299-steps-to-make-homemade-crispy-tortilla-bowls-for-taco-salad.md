recipeinstructions:
- "Place small oven-safe bowls upside down on baking sheet spaced far enough apart to accommodate the tortillas that will be draped over them. Only 2 will fit a standard size cookie sheet."
- "In a large skillet heat about 3/4-inch of oil to medium high while your oven is preheating to 350°F. When the oil is hot, using tong, slide a tortilla into the pan for ONLY 3 SECONDS. Pick up with the tongs allowing excess oil to drain back into the skillet."
- "Place the hot, oily tortilla over the inverted bowl and, with the tongs, gently shape against the bowl. They don&#39;t have to be perfect; just looking for a quasi-bowl shape that&#39;ll hold your ingredients when finished."
- "Place in 350° oven and bake for 6 minutes. Pull out of oven and carefully remove the HOT bowls, turn the tortillas right side up, and bake another 2 minutes. Since oven temperatures can vary, keep an eye on them. You can allow them to cool or keep warm in the oven while preparing the ingredients to fill them with."
- "I browned up hamburger with onions, garlic and Taco Bell Taco seasoning for ours. Shredded beef or chicken would also be yummy."
- "Place tortilla bowl on plate and fill as desired. Enjoy!"
