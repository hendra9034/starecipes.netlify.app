recipeingredient:
- " For the chicken and brine"
- "6 tablespoons Lawrys Seasoned Salt"
- "2 12 tablespoons garlic powder"
- "2 tablespoons cayenne pepper"
- "5 pounds chicken wings and drumettes"
- " For the breading and frying"
- " Canola oil for deepfrying"
- "4 cups allpurpose flour"
- "2 tablespoons Lawrys Seasoning Salt"
- "1 tablespoon cayenne pepper"
- " For the spicy honey butter"
- "115 g unsalted butter melted and cooled"
- "4 tablespoons Cholula hot sauce sorry it has to be Cholula"
- "2 tablespoons honey"
- "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt plus more to taste"
- " For oven roasted sweet potato wedges"
- "3 tbsp coconut oil"
- "2 egg whites"
- "2 tsp Lawrys seasoned salt"
- "680 g small sweet potatoes cut into 1 inch thick wedges"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brine the chicken:   In a really big pot or a 2-gallon zip-top plastic bag, combine 10 cups cold water, the seasoning salt, garlic powder, and cayenne. Add the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24."
- "Bread and fry the chicken:   Fill a soup pot with 6 inches of oil, making sure there are at least 4 inches of clearance between the oil and the lip of the pot."
- "Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 365°F on a deep-fry thermometer, or prepare a deep fryer according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions."
- "In a big bowl, combine the flour, seasoning salt, and cayenne. A few at a time, remove the wings from the brine and toss them in the flour mixture until coated really well, then place on a baking sheet while you coat the rest."
- "When the oil is ready, turn the heat up to medium-high and carefully slip in the wings, adding just enough so that there&#39;s still plenty of space around each wing."
- "Fry the wings until golden and crispy, about 13 minutes per batch. Drain the wings on plenty of paper towels. Fry the remaining chicken, letting the oil come back to temperature between batches."
- "Make the spicy honey butter: While the chicken is frying, in a bowl, whisk together the melted butter, Cholula, honey, and salt until incorporated. Taste and add more salt if necessary."
- "Slather the wings with the spicy honey butter and serve."
- "For oven roasted sweet potato wedges:  Preheat oven to 200ºC.  Heat oil on large shallow baking pan in oven until very hot, but not smoking, about 10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, beat egg whites in large bowl with electric mixer on medium-high until stiff peak form. Gently stir in seasoned salt until combined. Add sweet potatoes; toss to coat well."
- "Remove baking pan from oven, being careful not to spill hot oil. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer, flat side down, on baking pan."
- "Roast 25 - 30 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender and lightly browned, turning halfway through cooking. Sprinkle with additional seasoned salt, if desired."
