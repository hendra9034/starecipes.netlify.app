recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the water to cook the pasta.. Add generous salt inside the water"

- "In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese."
- "Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil until al dente (a little firm, not mushy)"
- "Use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon, mushroom and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water."
