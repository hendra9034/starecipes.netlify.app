- " Mixed herbs"
- " Salt  ground black pepper"

recipeinstructions:
- "Chop one of the red onions into thin strips. Do the same with the green pepper. And chop the chicken breasts into small pieces. Place them into a large bowl."
- "If you can&#39;t get madras paste, mix three tbsp of madras powder with water until it forms a paste. Then add three tbsp of the paste to the chicken, onion and pepper."
- "Mix the paste into the chicken, onion and pepper well with your hands until fully coated. Cover in cling wrap and put into the fridge for 1 hour."
- "Roughly chop the other red onions and the cloves of garlic. Fry in a pot for a few minutes or until soft. Add the chopped tomatoes, 1 heaped tbsp mixed herbs and salt &amp; pepper to taste. Stir well and let simmer for 20-30 minutes or until well reduced."
- "While the sauce is cooking make the dough. First preheat the oven to 200°c (fan)."
- "In a large mixing bowl add the flour and baking powder with 1 tbsp of oil and 1 tsp salt. Mix well. Then add 170ml of water and mix with your hands until it forms a ball. Add more water if needed but the dough shouldn&#39;t be too sticky. Then knead the dough for 4-5 minutes until elastic and smooth. Set aside."
- "Take the sauce from the pan and blitz it until smooth. This can be done in a food processor or with a handheld blitzer if you prefer."
- "Remove the chicken, onion and pepper mixture from the fridge and fry it in a pan (preferably non stick) with a bit of oil until the chicken is just cooked and the pepper and onion are softening."
- "Go back to the dough and separate it into 2 even balls, weigh the dough out if you want. Place each ball of dough onto a lightly floured surface and using a rolling in roll each ball out into a rough circle. Make it as thin as you can becuase it will puff up in the oven."
- "Line two flat baking trays with grease proof paper and place each base onto a tray. Place the tray into the oven for 5 minutes, no longer. They will have started to puff up and the base will be solid enough to add toppings."
- "Split the sauce between the two bases and smooth out, not going to the edges so there&#39;s a crust. Then lightly cover the sauce with an even mixture of cheddar and mozzarella."
- "Split the chicken, pepper and onion mixture between the bases. Then top with more cheddar and mozzarella."
- "Put the pizzas back into the oven for 12 minutes or until the cheese is brown and the base is crispy. Serve however you like, I served mine with a simple salad."
