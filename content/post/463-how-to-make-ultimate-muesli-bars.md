- "In a pan add 1 tsp ghee. Then add the jaggery and stir continuously till it reaches a viscous consistency."

- "Pour the mixture into the tray and press the mixture down as hard as you can with your hands or a large spoon. Rub a little oil on your hands/ spoon to stop the mixture sticking. Spend a few minutes doing this really well as it will help hold the muesli bar together."
- "Once the mixture is arranged properly into the tray, use a large knife the cut into bar shaped pieces. You don&#39;t have to separate the bar pieces, just make slight impressions, so that once the mixture is gets cool it can be seperated from the cut marks."
