- "1/2 tsp sugar"
- "11 g salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "Weigh all the ingredients and combine only the flours. Start by making your lievitino, which is similar to starting your own sourdough. Add the fresh yeast, sugar, 65 g of the water and 50 g of the flour mix to a bowl and let rise. Depending on the temperature this time may vary."
- "Add the salt to the remaining flour and mix well. When your lievitino is ready, create a well in the flour bowl, add the water to the little at the time and mix with a wooden spoon, by taking the flour closer the the centre. Half way, add your lievitino and carry on mixing until the flour is well combined. The dough will seem wet, but don&#39;t be temped to add any more flour. Cover with cling film, a tea towel and let rise overnight."
- "Next day flour a surface and pour the dough onto the flour. Do not knead, but fold the dough on itself and shape in a rectangle. Oil a baking tray and add the dough. Cover and let rise for about an hour or doubled in size, depending on the temperature."
- "After the rise, you should have a soft pillow ready to be seasoned. Make the classic holes using your fingers which have been floured, or you can use the handle of a floured wooden spoon. Cover in EVO, start with 3 tbsp, add fresh rosemary and sprinkle of Maldon salt flakes and bake at 190 c for about 30 minutes or golden. If you are adding the tomatoes, half them and add to the focaccia half way through the baking."
