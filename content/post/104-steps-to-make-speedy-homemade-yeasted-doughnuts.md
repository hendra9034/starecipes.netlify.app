- "All methods: once the dough has doubled, place on a floured surface. I divided the mix in half, keep the other half covered. Roll out the dough to about 1/2 an inch thick, then cut with a round cutter, about 3 inches in diameter, then cut out the holes with a smaller cutter about 1 inch.

Turn them once they are golden brown, once colored on both sides, remove them and place them on a plate lined with kitchen roll, then transfer to a cooling rack."
- "Sprinkle caster sugar on a plate. Once the doughnuts are cool enough to handle, roll them in the sugar and return back to the cooling rack."
- "To fill your doughnuts, use a long nozzle and pipe in the jam, if you’re feeling adventurous you could pipe in lots of other fillings, Nutella, apple sauce or custard.

- "Top Tip: When baking I only use fresh yeast, but if you can’t get your hand on fresh yeast just divide the weight of the yeast by 3. A good tip for getting fresh yeast is to ask at the bakery in your local Tesco, they always give you quite a big bag and what’s even better it’s FREE!!"
