recipeinstructions:
- "A. Tangzhong - Mix flour and water in a small pot and whisk until there is no lump. Heat this mixture over low heat, keep stirring until it turns into a thick paste. Tangzhong is ready when the spoon used to stir leaves a visible trail all the way to the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and leave to cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap to keep it from drying before adding to the bread dough. This tanzhong can be prepared the night before or an hour before baking."
- "B. The Dough - Place Tangzhong in a bread maker pan followed by the rest of the ingredients in the exact order listed in the recipe. Press the dough function and leave until it beeps and stops. Remove bread dough to a generously floured worktop. Punch the dough down. Dust dough and hands with flour before working on the sticky bread dough."
- "Divide dough to two equal portions. Flatten each dough and shape it to a rectangular that is longer and wider than the length and width of your bread pan. Fold the right long side to the left and the left side to the right. Do the same with the other two ends of the dough, making sure each folded loaf fits into your bread pan. At this stage, the size of the loaf does not have to cover the whole pan as this dough rises well after proofing."
- "Cover bread pans with sprayed or greased cling film and leave to rise for 1 - 1.5 hours or until double in size. To know if it has risen enough is when the dough rises well to the top of the pan. Note: This recipe makes two 600g loaves."
- "Tips: During winter, pour boiling water into a wide long pan and place it at the bottom of the oven. Place bread pans on the middle rack. This helps dough to rise well. Remove from the oven 15 minutes before baking as oven needs to be preheated."
- "20 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 150-160°C. Adjust oven temperature accordingly. Next, use a sharp knife or a razor to make a light cut or slash down the center of the bread dough. Slashing is optional. Next, brush the top of the loaf with milk (optional). Bake for 30-35 minutes. The top of the loaf will look lightly brown and make a hollow sound when tapped."
- "Remove baked loaves from the oven and immediately transfer them out from the pans to a cooling rack. Cover loaves with clean dry tea towel and leave to cool completely before cutting and storing. Cooled bread is easy to slice. I bake bread twice a week, usually in the evening and loaves ready around 10pm. Place loaves in a cooling rack, cover them completely with a tea towel and slice them in the morning."
