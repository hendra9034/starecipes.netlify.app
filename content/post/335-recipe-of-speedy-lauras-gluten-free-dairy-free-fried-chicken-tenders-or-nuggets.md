recipeingredient:
- " About 4 lb Chicken trimmed tenders or chicken breast cut into roughly 1 chunks"
- "2 Large eggs wellbeaten"
- "1/4 Cup Milk or original Almond Milk"
- "1/4 Cup Dill Pickle Juice"
- "2 Tbs. canola oil"
- "1 Tbs. Kosher Salt"
- "1 Tbs. Onion Powder"
- "1 Tbs. Garlic Powder"
- "2 tsp. Ground Black Pepper"
- "2 tsp. Ground Coriander"
- "1/4 tsp. Cayenne Pepper"
- "1/2-3/4 cup Gluten Free Flour recommend Bobs Red Mill 1 for 1 or Domata Recipe Ready"
- "4 Quarts Vegetable or Peanut Oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl combine eggs, milk, pickle juice, canola oil, and seasonings. Beat vigorously for about 1 minute until eggs are well-beaten and mixture is foamy."
- "Add flour and whisk until well blended. Mixture should be about the consistency of a thin pancake batter"
- "Add all the chicken. to the mixture. Churn by hand for about 1 minute to work mix into the tenders. Let sit for at least 15-30 minutes. (Or refrigerate for several hours)"
- "Heat 3-4 quarts of frying oil in a heavy pot or Dutch oven to 350° F. (Tip: The heavier the pan, the better. A heavy pan will retain heat and maintain consistent oil temperature)"
- "Working in small batches, Lower tenders into the oil gently and slowly, so not to splash hot oil or knock the batter off. Avoid putting too many pieces in at one time."
- "Fry for 6-8 minutes (depending on size of pieces) until dark golden brown. Pieces will start to float as they near doneness. As the pieces start to float, gently move and rotate them to ensure even finish of the crust."
- "Remove tenders with tongs (or spider), allow for drip for a few seconds, and place on a wire rack over sheet pan to cool. Make sure to arrange in a single-layer so pieces cool evenly and to prevent moisture from condensing. Moisture will ruin the crunch of the batter!"
- "Repeat frying until all the chicken is cooked. Make sure to allow oil to come back up to 350 degrees between batches. Frying in too cold of oil will make the chicken greasy and the crust won’t get as crunchy."
- "Lightly sprinkle chicken with sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste, after frying. Enjoy!"
