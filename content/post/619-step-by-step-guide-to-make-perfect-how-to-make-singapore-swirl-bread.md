- "13 g unsalted butter at room temperature and softened  more for greasing"
recipeinstructions:
- "This is how it looks like. I am not a fan of durian, so this is for my daughter. If you can see, the bread is made up of green and purple colors. This recipe is inspired by this iconic Singapore street food."
- "Prepare the yudane.  In a shallow bowl, add flour and water.  *The water has to be boiling.*  Stir to combine well."
- "It should be a sticky roux.  Spread out to cool down faster.  Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel.  Set aside to cool down to room temperature.  Once cool, divide into 2 equal portions."
- "Prepare the pandan dough.  Add pandan leaves and water into a blender and blitz until smooth.  Transfer thru&#39; a fine sieve over a bowl.  Using the back of a spoon, squeeze as much juice out as humanly can.  *You should have 100g worth of pandan juice. If it is less, add more water.*"
- "In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and yeast well.  *Do not add the yeast directly on the salt. It will kill the yeast.*  Gradually pour the pandan juice and coconut cream into the flour mixture while still mixing with a spatula.  Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour are kneaded into the dough, about 5 mins."
- "Transfer onto a lightly floured surface.  Add in half of the yudane.  Knead for about 5 mins until the yudane is fully incorporated.  Add in the butter.  Continue kneading for another 3 to 5 mins."
- "Do take note that the yukane and butter has to be at room temperature.*  The dough should be tacky, fluffy, smooth and it should pass the &#34;window-pane&#34; test.  If the dough is too dry, add in water, 1 TBSP at a time. If the dough is too sticky, add in flour, 1 TBSP at a time.  Lightly grease the bowl with some butter.  Transfer the dough back to the greased bowl.  Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 30 mins."
- "Prepare the ube dough.  In a large bowl, combine flour, ube powder, sugar, salt and yeast well.  *Do not add the yeast directly on the salt. It will kill the yeast.*  Gradually pour the water and coconut cream into the flour mixture while still mixing with a spatula.  Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour are kneaded into the dough, about 5 mins."
- "Transfer onto a lightly floured surface.  Add in the remaining half of the yudane.  Knead for about 5 mins until the yudane is fully incorporated.  Add in the butter.  Continue kneading for another 3 to 5 mins.  *Do take note that the yukane and butter has to be at room temperature.*"
- "The dough should be tacky, fluffy, smooth and it should pass the &#34;window-pane&#34; test.  If the dough is too dry, add in water, 1 TBSP at a time. If the dough is too sticky, add in flour, 1 TBSP at a time.  Lightly grease the bowl with some butter.  Transfer the dough back to the greased bowl.  Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 30 mins."
- "The 2 dough should slightly risen.  Punch down the dough and fold the top, sides and bottom to the center.  Flip, cover and let rise for 1 hr.  This process is sorta to ensure that the yeast is activated.  Both of the dough should be doubled in size.  *You can do a test by poking a floured finger into the dough. If it doesn&#39;t spring back, the yeast is activated properly and the dough is ready.*"
- "Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Form each dough into balls.  Cover with a lint-free kitchen towel and let rest for 15 mins. This is called the bench rest which allows the gluten to relax.  Grease bread pan with butter."
- "You will need a large working surface for the following steps.*  Roll ube dough into a large rectangle with the width almost the same as the length of the bread pan with a rolling pin.  Repeat the same for the pandan dough.  Swiftly place the ube dough on top of the pandan dough."
- "Stretch and adjust the width and length if needed.  Lightly roll with a rolling pin to adhere.  Roll the dough into a log like a Swiss roll or cinnamon buns.  Pinch the sims to seal tightly."
- "Transfer into the greased bread pan simmed side down.  Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 40 to 50 mins.  Preheat oven to 200 degree celsius or 400 fahrenheit.  The dough balls should rise about 1/2 inch away to the top of the loaf pan.  Close the lid and wack into the oven."
- "Bake for 40 to 1 hr or until the crust is golden brown.  Remove from the oven.  Immediately unmold onto a wire cooling rack.  Set aside to cool down completely before slicing."
