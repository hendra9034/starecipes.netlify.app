recipeingredient:
- " Veggie scraps perfectly washed and clean"
- "2 boneless chicken thighs"
- " Fresh or dry ramen noodles"
- "1 Roasted Nori sheet"
- "2 eggs"
- "1/2 cup soy sauce"
- "1/2 cup chicken stock or dashi stock"
- "1 clove garlic"
- "1 inch slice of fresh ginger"
- "1 scallion"
- "2 tsp brown sugar"
- "1 tsp rice vinegar"
- "1/4 cup mirin"
- "1/4 cup sake or dry white wine"
- " Toppings of your choice"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put veggie scraps in a large heavy pot and cover with water. Add around 2 tsp of salt, and bring to a boil. Boil them in high heat for about an hour tops."
- "Remove the pot from the fire and strain the veggie scraps, reserving the resulting broth. It will be very bland. Don&#39;t worry, you can adjust the seasoning later."
- "In a sauce pan mix the chicken or dashi stock with the soy sauce, the mirin, sake, sugar, rice vinegar, smashed garlic and ginger, and scallion. Stir and bring to a simmer. Cook on low heat until the mixture has reduced to about 1/2 cup of liquid. Be careful not to let the soy sauce burn. This will be the Tare, and will adjust the seasoning of the ramen."
- "Boil two eggs, straight from the fridge, for 6 minutes. Start counting once the water starts boiling. The yolk should come up soft, or at least, perfectly yellow with no grayish rim."
- "Add salt and pepper to both chicken thighs. In a skillet, cook the thighs skin side down first, until crispy and golden. Then flip and repeat. Set aside to rest, then cut each thigh into bite size strips."
- "Cook the ramen noodles as instructed in the package. If you can&#39;t find any, use fresh spaghetti and replace the salt in the water with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Around 2 tsp should do."
- "Fold the nori sheet four times and cut it into little rectangles."
- "Finally, assemble the ramen: place 3 tbsp of tare in the bottom of the bowl, then add the noodles, followed by 4 ladlefuls of veggie broth. Place the toppings on top (the chicken thigh, and the egg sliced in half, and 4 nori sheets). I also added a shitake mushroom, a few slices of carrot, and corn. Be creative, and add any topping you want. Some flavoured oil can also add a great finishing touch (chilli oil, sesame oil, garlic oil, etc)."
