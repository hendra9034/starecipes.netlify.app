- " Cherry Jam"
- "400 g Pitted Cherries"
- "200 g Caster Sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "To make the jam, add your cherries to a saucepan and gently soften."
- "Add your sugar and incorporate well into the pan until fully dissolved."
- "Bring the mix to the boil, add your lemon juice and simmer until the jam reaches 105 degrees Celsius."
- "The jam should now be thicker in consistency with almost all of the liquid evaporated."
- "Place the jam into jars or ramekins and allow to cook slightly."
- "Cover with a lid or clingfilm and allow to set."
- "For the pastry, combine the flour and butter and mix to resemble fine breadcrumbs."
- "Add the coconut sugar and combine."
- "Add in your egg and incorporate into the mix."
- "Add a dash of milk to bring the ingredients together and form a dough."
- "Once your dough is formed and firm, wrap in cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes before use."
- "Pre heat your oven to 180 degrees and grease a tart case with a little butter."
- "Once your dough has been refrigerated, roll out on a floured surface and line your tart case. Press gently into the case, and dock the base with a fork. This will prevent the pastry from rising when baking."
- "Cover the tart case with greaseproof paper and add baking beans or rice onto the base. This is called blind baking and allows the base from rising in the oven."
- "Bake for 15 Minutes at 180 degrees until the pastry is set around the edges."
- "Remove the baking beans and parchment and continue to cook for an extra 10 minutes to allow the base to set."
- "Remove the base from the oven and allow to cool."
- "While the base is cooling we can make the frangipane filling. Combine the sugar and butter and whisk until light and fluffy."
- "Add your ground almonds and combine"
- "Add in your eggs and whisk to combine and form a smooth mixture."
- "To assemble the Bakewell tart, trim the edges of your pastry case and add your jam to the base, smoothing it out over the complete surface of the base."
- "Add your frangipane mix over the cherry jam, making sure the filling is level in the case."
- "Lower the oven to 150 degrees and bake for 25 minutes or until the filling has risen slightly and golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cook before serving."
