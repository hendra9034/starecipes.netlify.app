recipeinstructions:
- "Add the sugar, yeast into the lukewarm water. Mix and leave for 10 minutes to allow the yeast to activate."
- "Place the flour in a bowl together with the salt,olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Mix to a smooth dough by hand Or use electric mixer.  Place the dough on a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes to achieve a smooth and elastic consistency."
- "Place in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover, and leave in a warm place for about an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.  Turn the risen dough out onto a floured surface and knock it back.

Re-cover the dough and place in a warm place for another 20-30 minutes. Now for the seasoning. Drizzle on the oil, sprinkle on some parsely, sea salt and black pepper, then add on the slices of onion. Bake at 180°C for 20-25 minutes. Remove the focaccia from the tin and place on a wire rack to cool."
- "#Notes:  This is so well seasoned that you can eat wedges of this as a snack. A small piece would make a nice addition to a child’s lunchbox.  There are many varieties of focaccia. Some have different herbs while others are topped with cheese and meat. Vegetables can also be added into the dough, as well as sliced oilves."
