Add ginger, garlic and green chillies and stir fry for a few second. Add the remaining spices, mashed boiled potatoes and salt. mash everything together and then mix it. give it one more good mix and then set the mixture aside to cool completely."
- "üåªWrapping the samosas:  Take a lime sized bowl of dough, roll it between your palms till smooth and dust it with flour. Roll it out into a circle which is less than 1 mm thickness and about 6 inches in diameter. Cut the rolled dough in half. Pick up one half and brush it with a little water along the straight edge of the pastry."
- "Now take one edge of the straight side, and place it on the other edge of the straight side in such a way that the dough forms into a cone shape.Pinch the corner of the cone so that its sealed. Place a tablespoon and a half of the filling in the cone, making sure to fill it only 3/4th of the way."
- "Brush the inside of the unfilled dough with a little water and seal it by pinching the edge together. Repeat till all the dough is used up. Place the samosas on a greased tray making sure they don‚Äôt touch each other and cover them with a damp cloth."
- "Heat oil in a pan. To test if the oil is hot enough, add a tiny piece of dough to the oil and if it bubbles and floats on the surface, your oil is ready for frying. Add the samosas to the oil making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and reduce the flame to a simmer."
- "Fry the samosas on a low flame till golden brown on both side. Its important to fry them on a low flame, or the pastry would be raw from the inside and golden brown on the outside. Take them out on a plate lined with paper to absorb any extra oil and serve them immediately with ketchup / chutney."
