- "Add carrot and cabbage. Cook until vegetables are wilted. Add salt, a little bit of sugar and pepper, cook until the liquid is gone. The Filling should not be watery, it should be kind of dry (watery filling = soggy spring rolls). Give a taste. Add more seasoning as needed."
- "Add green onion. Give a couple of stir. Turn off the heat."
- "Cool the filling. The filling can be made a day before."
- "Making the wrappers : Put all the ingredients for the wrapper in a blender. Process until you get smooth batter. The texture batter should be like crepe batter. Take about 1/4 cup of batter and put aside. This is going to be used to &#34;glue/seal&#34; the spring rolls."

- "Place the wrapper with the smooth side down. Place the filling on the bottom. Top with 4 slices of hard boiled egg. Roll up halfway, fold sides in, then finish rolling. Use the batter that you put aside to seal."
- "Pour enough oil in a wok or large saucepan so it is double the height of the spring rolls. Heat on medium high until hot - stick a bamboo chopstick or wooden spoon handle in, if rapid bubbles appear, then it&#39;s hot enough."
- "Carefully place spring rolls in the oil (about 4 - 5 at a time) and cook, turning occasionally, until deep golden. Transfer to paper towels to drain."
- "Repeat with remaining spring rolls. Serve while hot with Sweet and Sour Sauce!"
- "Note :  You do not need to always fry this spring rolls. My preference is to eat them fresh without deep frying them."
