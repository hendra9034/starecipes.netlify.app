- "Unroll crescent rolls and divide into four portions. You should end up with four squares. They may not be exactly equal but don’t sweat it, if you end up with four at the end your doing great!"
- "Mix chicken, milk, cream cheese, minced onion, pimentos, salt and pepper in bowl. Mix it and slap it.  Ok, don’t slap it. Unless you did, then bravo for following the directions. But just to be clear, no slapping.   *Tip: Remember that chicken breast recipe I shared last week? This would be a good time to use it."
- "Spoon chicken mixture in each square. Too much or to little? That is the question. Eyeball it.  If you mess up, unroll and do it again. It’s okay."
- "Fold dough to cover chicken mixture and pinch at the sides to keep mixture in. Diagonal, square, whatever. Roll the dough to cover the mixture completely. It might not look pretty but we are not pastry chefs Stacey!   Disclaimer: “Stacey” is a fictional character we made up that sticks her nose up at ugly dough."
- "Brush with egg wash or melted butter. You can also sprinkle sea salt or Parmesan cheese on top."
- "Bake in 350 F degree oven for 20 minutes. Take out and let rest on counter for at least 5-10 minutes. Enjoy!   *Tip: Remember the comfy pants I mentioned earlier. This is when you will thank me for this tip. Rog had one and then came back into the kitchen for another. They are addicting!"
