- " blue cheesefeta cheese"
- " dillparsley chopped"
- " whole grain mustard"
- " hot sauce to taste"
- " salt  pepper to taste"
- " mayonnaise"

recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the chicken from the bone and place into a large mixing bowl. Add chopped celery, chopped herbs, and cheese to the bowl."
- "Wash and quarter your red potatoes. Boil in salted water until a fork will easily pierce the potato. Remove from the stove and drain. Allow to come to a room temperature and then add to the mixing bowl."
- "Add a tablespoon or more of whole grain mustard and salt &amp; pepper."
- "Now comes the saucing. Add equal amounts of mayonnaise and greek yogurt to the bowl. Mix. You want the components to all be covered but not drowning in white. I recommend adding half of what you think you will use and then adding more mayo if you&#39;d like a creamier chicken salad or more greek yogurt if you’d like a little more tang."
- "The next step up to you! Enjoy this chicken salad in a sandwich or wrap, put a scoop on your salad, or if you’re like me crunch up some potato chips and sprinkle them on top of a heaping bowl and lunch/dinner/snack is served!"
- "Either mayo or greek yogurt can be used, I like the combination but if one tickles your fancy go with it. The only hard and fast rule of chicken salad is NO MIRACLE WHIP. That’s all."
- "Proportions, proportions, proportions. I play with the proportions and ratios of this salad all the time, but as I said above it really does depend on how much fried chicken I have leftover. I typically make large batches of chicken salad and have it throughout the week for lunch/dinner/snacks."
- "I pick the fried chicken off the bone over the mixing bowl so that all the crunchy bits of breading fall in and I have more crunch in my salad!"
