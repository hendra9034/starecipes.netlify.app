- "1-2 onions"
- "2 green peppers"
- "1 handful corn kernels"
- "3 eggs"

- "1 chicken stock tablet"
- "1 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1/2 tsp dried thyme"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put rice, chicken stock tablet and a cup of water in a pot. Cook it on low heat until you get a fluffy texture.  If you have leftover rice, use that with this recipe. Or rest your cooked rice for a day in the refrigerator. Trust me, it tastes much better and the texture is so good. It won’t get mushy."

- "Put the remaining oil into the same pan and add vegetables until they’re soft. Add sucuk later, it crisps up easily, don’t make it go dry. And add the scrambled eggs.   Add a pinch of salt, black pepper and dried thyme.  Stir fry all the garnishes a little bit before adding the rice."
- "Add the rice and go on stir frying until rice gets warm and all of the flavors are combined."
