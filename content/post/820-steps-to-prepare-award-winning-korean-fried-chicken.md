Likewise, flour coat every chicken piece and keep aside in a dry plate for 5 to 7 mins. Heat oil in a wok for deep frying until the oil temperature reaches 350degrees. Bring down the heat and drop the flour coated chicken pieces into the hot oil. Keep frying the chicken in low heat until they give out beige colour."

Though the original recipe calls for sugar, Adding sugar is optional here. I omitted sugar as we prefer spicy spicy version. Let the chicken sit in the sauce and get fried for another 2 minutes or until they get that sauce coated and crunch effect. Throw in some white sesame seeds. Drizzle sesame oil. Give a quick toss."
- "Here we go, Hot hot Korean Fried Chicken is ready to serve."
