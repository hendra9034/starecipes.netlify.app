recipeingredient:
- " Whole red pepper 200g"
- " Whole aubergine 200g"
- " Approx 12 Cherry tomatoes 200g"
- " large red onion 175g"
- " chicken breasts 300g"
- " garlic"
- " table spoons of harissa pesto of preferred"
- " Olive oil"
- " giant wholewheat couscous"
- " chicken stock cube"
- " pumpkin seeds"
- " feta cheese"
- " Balsamic glaze"
recipeinstructions:
- "Firstly preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius, chop the vegetables to be roasted, into large chunks, pepper, onion, courgette and aubergine. (Leave some onion to go with the chicken - 3 pieces) Drizzle with olive oil and season according to taste. I used salt, pepper and garlic powder. These need to be cooked for 45 mins at 170 degrees."
- "The next thing to prepare is the chicken, place the breasts in an ovenproof dish, with the left over onion chunks and the garlic cloves (peeled and crushed). Spoon the harissa (if you aren’t keen on spice, use red pesto!) onto the chicken breasts and drizzle a little olive oil on the onion and garlic, place in the oven for ten minutes initially, before covering with foil."
- "Next to prepare the tomatoes as they only take 25 mins to roast, put them onto an oven proof dish and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place in the oven. When doing this, check on the other roasting vegetables and turn them if necessary. If the chicken has been in 10 mins - add half a stock cube and 150ml of boiling water and cover with foil. This is to prevent the chicken from drying out."
- "Once everything is in the oven, keep an eye on it all. The chicken will need 10 mins uncovered, then 20 covered then 10 uncovered again. The other vegetables just continue roasting for 45 mins and the tomatoes shorter."
- "After about 30 mins, weigh out the giant cous cous and use the second half of the stock cube to simmer the cous cous in. (Follow the instructions on the cous cous packet, they are all a little different) bring the stock to the boil, add the cous cous and simmer for as long as directed."
- "Everything should begin to look like it’s almost done, when the chicken has been in 40 mins, cut through and check the juices are running clear. If so, leave to stand. Then remove the tomatoes as they should be done. When the cous cous is softened, drain it."
- "Now you can begin to assemble the dish, I started with the giant cous cous."
- "Then added the roasted vegetables, the tomatoes and the chicken. I then took the juices from the chicken dish (It’s a mixture of harissa and stock - very tasty!) and spooned it all over the dish."
- "I then added the crumbled feta, some balsamic glaze and topped with pumpkin seeds for added texture. Enjoy!!"
