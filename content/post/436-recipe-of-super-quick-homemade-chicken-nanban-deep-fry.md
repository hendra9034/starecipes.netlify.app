recipeinstructions:
- "First step is to pour our enough oil into a frying pan to cover the chicken and heat up to 350 degrees at medium-high heat. Check it to make sure it doesn&#39;t go above 350. You want to maintain that cooking temp the entire time."
- "Lets make the Tarter sauce because you want to mix it up and keep it in the fridge until your ready to serve it."
- "Now you want to make the Nanban sauce so take out a small pan set heat to medium-low and add in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar together. Heat until sugar is dissolved. Now remove from the heat and put in the sauce in a bake dish or bowl and save for later."
- "Take out the chicken thighs and try to buy the ones from the Japanese market as they are bigger and taste better then the American grocery shops. Flatten out the thighs, and give them some salt and pepper on both sides. Next take out two pans one with all-purpose flour and the other with the beaten egg. Coat the chicken in the flour then right into the beating egg and add into the frying oil. Cook until golden brown."
- ""
- "Once cooked all the way through remove the chicken from the oil and transfer directly into your nanban sauce. Coat the chicken on both side and remove them to a cutting board and cut up the thigh into 7-8 strips. Now add them on to your serving plate and take a scoop of the tartar sauce you had in the fridge and put on top of the chicken. Serve with green salad or fresh green. You can also add more nanban sauce if you like it more wet."
- "I hope you like this recipe. I have made this many times and it is very good. Arigato from The Food Dude and Cheers."
