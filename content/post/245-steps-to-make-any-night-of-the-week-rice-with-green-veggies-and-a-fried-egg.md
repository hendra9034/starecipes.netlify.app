recipeinstructions:
- "Cut up the cucumber into thin strips and set aside. Then, heat up a skillet with the vinegar and water on high heat. As soon as it starts bubbling, add the salt and sugar and take it off of the heat. Pour the liquid onto the sliced cucumber into a heat-safe dish and let it pickle for at least 30 mins or 24 hours for the best results."
- "After you place the cucumber into the fridge, measure out the rice then rinse 2-3x until it runs clear. Place a large enough pot on the stove with the lid off and boil water with the salt added on high heat. After the water boils, add the rice and the lid then turn the heat down to low. This takes 15 mins to cook."
- "While the rice is cooking, add a bit of oil to a skillet on med-high heat then add the bell peppers and water. After letting the peppers sweat for about 10 mins until the water is nearly evaporated, add the salt and cayenne pepper then stir for another 5 mins. After the peppers cook for a little bit, transfer them into a heat-safe bowl."
- "I wasn&#39;t too worried about the residue from the peppers when using the skillet again to cook the eggs. What I did was take some tongs and a bit of paper towel to get some of the residue but not all of it. I added a bit more oil again to fry up the eggs with the salt, pepper, and dried chives on med. heat."
- "To serve, remove the lid from the pot containing the rice and take up a portion size. You then add the egg, peppers, and cucumber along with Sriracha, soya sauce, and sesame seeds."
- "Enjoy!"
