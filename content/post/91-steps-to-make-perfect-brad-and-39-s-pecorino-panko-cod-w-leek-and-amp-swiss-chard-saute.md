recipeinstructions:

- "Separate the ribs from the leaves of the Swiss chard. Course chop leaves and set aside. Thinly slice the chard ribs. Cut off the leek leaves. Thinly slice leeks as well. Discard or use the leek leaves for the broth."

Then remove lid and saute until everything is tender and the liquid has reduced to a sauce."
- "Cooking the chard has to be timed with the fish. First dredge the fish in flour. Then egg, then panko. Coat well. Either deep fry or pan fry until golden brown."
- "Plate swiss chard, arrange fish on top. Squeeze a wedge of lemon over all. Grate a little pecorino on top. Arrange prosciutto crisps around the edge. Serve immediately, and please enjoy."
