recipeinstructions:
- "Start heating your oil over med-high heat, or whatever frying componet you chose to fry up your chicken legs. I chose to use a mixture of veg. oil and crisco."
- "In a med-lg mixing bowl, mix together flour and old bay seasoning."

- "When oil is ready place the lightly floured chicken legs in oil. (to know if your oil is ready drop a pinch of flour in. If it sizzles its ready!) Coat the remainig chicken legs in flour and if your have room place in frying pot. DO NOT OVER CROWD YOUR POT! This will result in longer frying time and unevenly cooked chicken legs."
- "Fry untill your chicken legs are a nice golden shade and extra crispy. 7-10 mins either side depending on the depth of your frying pot and size of your chicken legs. You may have to change your heat depending on your stove range, Im cooking on a gas range."
- "When done place chicken legs on a plate lined with a paper towl to drain the oil."

- "Next add all your chicken legs, and cover with lid. Using a dish towel grab the handles of your pot while holding the lid on and toss the chicken legs making sure all your chicken legs get evenly coated with the BBQ Sauce. Try my J&#39;s BBQ Sauce recipe."
