Likewise, flour coat every chicken piece and keep aside in a dry plate for 5 to 7 mins. Heat oil in a wok for deep frying until the oil temperature reaches 350degrees. Bring down the heat and drop the flour coated chicken pieces into the hot oil. Keep frying the chicken in low heat until they give out beige colour."

- "2 step fried chicken is ready. Drain out excess oil and keep aside."
- "For final sauce coating step, add 3 tablespoons hot oil (used for frying chicken) in a wide pan. Add the ground chilli paste to the hot oil. Keep cooking the paste until raw smell disappears. You can see the colour turning rich and deep. Add vinegar."
- "Then pour in soya sauce. Mix and cook for a min. Drop in the fried chicken pieces. Quickly toss and coat the fried chicken in the spicy sauce. Though the original recipe calls for sugar, Adding sugar is optional here. I omitted sugar as we prefer spicy spicy version. Let the chicken sit in the sauce and get fried for another 2 minutes or until they get that sauce coated and crunch effect. Throw in some white sesame seeds. Drizzle sesame oil. Give a quick toss."
