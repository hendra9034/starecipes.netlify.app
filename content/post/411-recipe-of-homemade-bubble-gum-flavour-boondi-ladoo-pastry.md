recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl sieve the gram flour and add oil and water and make a smooth batter.  Let it rest for an hour."
- "While its resting prepare sugar syrup 10 minutes before making bundi.  In a large pan add sugar and water and make sugar syrup. It should be of no strings at all. Add in flavour and colour to the syrup. I have used bubblegum flavour and used pink food colour. You can make green, orange, red etc"
- "Add food colour and mix the batter well.  In a large frying pan add oil and heat on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, hold a grater or holed ladle over the oil (about 2”)and pour the batter gently using a ladle. The bundi will start dropping in the oil. Let the bundi fry for a minute or so. It should all float on top and remove using a ladle and remove any oil by shaking it and put in the syrup."
- "Stir the bundi and remove once all soaked in syrup. Transfer in a colander so any excess syrup is drained. Repeat for the rest of the batter and once the excess syrup is drained transfer in a dish and add ghee, saffron and nuts to it. You can also add raisins and trutti frutti. If not using flavour add cardamom powder.  I have given a twist to it. I blitz the boondi in a blender and made small ladoos and put it on top of vol au vent cases. Enjoy"
