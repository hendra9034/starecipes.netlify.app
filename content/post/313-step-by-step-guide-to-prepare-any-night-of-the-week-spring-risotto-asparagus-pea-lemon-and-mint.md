recipeingredient:
- "1 cup arborio rice"
- "1 bunch asparagus"
- "1 cup peas"
- "1 shallot"
- "2 cloves garlic"
- "1 bunch fresh mint chopped"
- "1-2 cups chicken or veg stock"
- "Half glass white wine"
- " Parmesan cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Break the stems off the asparagus spears by hand.           (see tip)"
- "Slice the asparagus and sautÃ© with the peas. Set to one side. (This is an important step to keep the asparagus firm at the end and not to over cook with the rice)."
- "Dice the shallot and garlic and soften in the pan with oil."
- "Add the rice and a knob of butter. Let the rice take on some flavour."
- "Then add white wine. Let the alcohol evaporate off and then start adding stock little by little."
- "Add the juice of a lemon near the end of cooking so a subtle lemon flavour joins the rice."
- "Keep adding stock until the rice is al dente. You can tell the texture is right when it looks like this. It should still move a little.           (see tip)"
- "When the rice is ready add the greens, grated Parmesan and chopped mint leaves."
- "Tip: I always add a tiny bit more stock and a knob of butter to get a creamy texture."
- "Season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with Parmesan shavings and lemon zest...donâ€™t forget that glass of white wine ðŸ˜‰"
