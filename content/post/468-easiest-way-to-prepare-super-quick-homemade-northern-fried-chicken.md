recipeingredient:
- "4-6 boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts"
- "3 egg whites"
- "1 1/2 cup all purpose flour"
- "1/2 cup fine breadcrumbs"
- "1 1/2 tsp granulated onion or onion powder"
- "1 1/2 tsp granulated garlic or garlic powder"
- "1/2 tsp paprika"
- "1/2 tsp cayenne"
- " sea salt"
- " Canola oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dry brine the chicken for about 4 hours: simply season with salt and then place in the bottom shelf of the fridge uncovered. This will season the chicken and keep it dry. Take the chicken out 30 minutes before cooking."
- "Bring a deep, heavy bottom pot no more than halfway filled with some high smoke point oil like canola or vegetable oil and let that heat up on medium heat to about 375F."
- "In a bowl, separate the egg white from the yolks and gently whisk to slightly foam the whites. Set aside. Reserve the yolks for scrambled eggs or for a dish like Carbonara."
- "In another bowl, combine the flour, breadcrumbs, and spices. Set aside."
- "Dip the chicken into the egg whites, make sure they are well coated, then dip in the flour mixture and really be rough with it, you want flour completely covering the chicken and even better to have little chunks of clumped up flour. Once all the chicken is dredged, they are ready to fry."
- "Drop the chicken in the oil few pieces at a time. The most important part of frying is heat management. As soon as you add the chicken, the temp of the oil will drop. So you are going to have to use a thermometer and try to regulate the temp by hand to try and keep it around 350-375F so that the dredge can get properly crispy and the inside stays perfectly cooked."
- "Once the internal temp of the chicken is around 185-210F and is golden brown, pull out of the oil and let it drain on a rack or oil absorbent paper. Finish frying the rest of the batch."
