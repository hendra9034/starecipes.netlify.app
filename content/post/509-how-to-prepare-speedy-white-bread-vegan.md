recipeingredient:
- " bread flour"
- " sachet of yeast"
- " salt"
- " water"
- " plant milk"
- " sugar"
- " sunflower oil"
- " Extra oil for brushing and extra flour on standby for adjusting the dough if needed and for dusting the worksurface"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the sugar, water and milk into a jug. Warm for 30 seconds in the microwave and then add the oil.  Put the flour, yeast and salt into the bowl of your stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Now run the mixer for a quick 20-30 seconds to make sure they are well mixed. With a low speed setting, gradually pour in the wet ingredients."
- "Pause once the wet and dry ingredients are well-combined, and adjust with a LITTLE flour if it is too sticky, or a LITTLE water if it is too dry. Once satisfied, continue to knead. The dough is ready when is is smooth, forms a ball and bounces back on poking. It&#39;s easy to over-knead in a food mixer so take care not to knead too long!"
- "Prove the dough. You can just leave it to rise in the bowl for an hour or so, if your kitchen is warm.   If you have a minute though, it is worth the small effort to turn the dough out, clean the bowl and brush oil around the inside. Put the dough back in and leave to rise in a warm spot for about an hour."
- "When it has risen, turn the dough out onto a floured surface, shape it into a ball and leave it to rest for 10 minutes. Prepare the loaf tin by brushing the inside with a little oil. Shape the dough into a loaf and place this in the loaf tin. Leave this in a warm place to rise again for at least half an hour.  If you&#39;ve not shaped a loaf before, here are some useful instructions: https://www.thekitchn.com/basic-techniques-how-to-shape-97063"
- "Turn on the oven about 10 minutes before the second rise is finished, and pre-heat to 220C. You want to put the loaf in a very hot oven to get a good crust. Use a sharp knife to cut a slash in the top of the loaf. Put the loaf in the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 180C. Bake for 30 minutes (or until done)."
