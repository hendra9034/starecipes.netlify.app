- "To assemble the Bakewell tart, trim the edges of your pastry case and add your jam to the base, smoothing it out over the complete surface of the base."
- "Add your frangipane mix over the cherry jam, making sure the filling is level in the case."
- "Lower the oven to 150 degrees and bake for 25 minutes or until the filling has risen slightly and golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cook before serving."
