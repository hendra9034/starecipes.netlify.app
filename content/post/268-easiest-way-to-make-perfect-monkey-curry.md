recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare Proteins - Chicken Breasts: Cut raw breasts into small chunks about half-thumb size  Shrimp: Remove shells  Season either protein being used with salt &amp; pepper"
- "Prepare Tomatoes - The tomatoes can be left chunky, or blended for a smoother final texture  Fresh: Dice tomatoes into small pieces (For added smoothness, try scoring, blanching and peeling the tomato skins)  Canned: No further prep.  Blend if you intend to now."
- "Prepare Potatoes -  Peel and cut potatoes about half-thumb size"
- "Prepare Onions - Dice onions into small pieces"
- "Prepare Garlic - Peel and mince garlic"
- "Prepare ginger - Peel and finely mince ginger"
- "Begin Cooking rice - Rinse and begin cooking rice in your rice maker"
- "Cook potatoes - (This step can be done along side the next one if you&#39;re comfortable with cooking two separate ingredients)  Add 1-2 Tbsp of cooking oil to the frying pan and add potatoes.  Add pepper and LIBERAL amounts of salt.  Continue to toss and fry potatoes on high heat until a brown crust has formed.

- "Cooking Tomatoes - Add your tomatoes to the pot. If you did not blend the tomatoes, also add around ½ cup of water.  We&#39;ll be cooking the tomatoes down into a smooth texture so additonal water may be needed throughout the cooking process if the mixture gets too dry"

- "Continuing cooking - Continue to cook the mixture in the pot until you&#39;re happy with the texture, then add your dairy products.  I aim for an orange-yellow color now  Now is when you can start to refine the taste as the dish is nearing completion.  This step can be extended by just adding small amounts of water to the pot."
- "Cooking Proteins - Add 2 tsp cooking oil to the frying pan and get cook protein on high heat until slightly browned and cooked through"
- "Final Steps - Ensure the flavour of your curry is what you&#39;d like, and then add the cooked potatoes and chicken to the pot.  Add additional milk / cream / water if needed.  The final product should be a thick and creamy curry  Plate with rice and you&#39;re done!"
