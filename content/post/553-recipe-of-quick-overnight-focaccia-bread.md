- "Add the salt to the remaining flour and mix well. When your lievitino is ready, create a well in the flour bowl, add the water to the little at the time and mix with a wooden spoon, by taking the flour closer the the centre.

- "After the rise, you should have a soft pillow ready to be seasoned. Make the classic holes using your fingers which have been floured, or you can use the handle of a floured wooden spoon. Cover in EVO, start with 3 tbsp, add fresh rosemary and sprinkle of Maldon salt flakes and bake at 190 c for about 30 minutes or golden. If you are adding the tomatoes, half them and add to the focaccia half way through the baking."
