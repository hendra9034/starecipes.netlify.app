recipeingredient:
- " For the Saffron Rice"
- "2 pinches saffron threads"
- "1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain"
- "1 small yellow onion minced about 12 cup"
- "2 cups long grain white rice or basmati"
- "3 3/4 cups low sodium chicken stock or water"
- " For the Cod"
- " Four 4ounce skinless cod fillets about 34  1inch in thickness"
- "6 cups Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain"
- " For the Roasted Tomatoes"
- "10.5 ounces or 2 cups cherry or cherub pear tomatoes"
- "2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain"
- " For the Fried Capers"
- "1/2 cup capers drained and patted dry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the cod: remove the cod from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour."
- "Prepare the saffron rice: place one pinch of saffron threads in a spice mortar and crush them with the pestle. Add the second pinch of saffron but don’t crush. Pour in 1/4 cup of hot water in the mortar and let sit for 5 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add minced onions and sauté until the onions begin to lightly brown. Add the rice to the pot and continue to sauté for 1 minute more. Add the saffron liquid and the broth (or water), stir to incorporate the saffron, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered until ready to plate."
- "Poach the cod: position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 225°F. In a 10-inch sauté pan, saucepan, or Dutch oven heat 6 cups of Extra Virgin Olive Oil to 120° F. Use a thermometer to get to this exact temperature."
- "Once the cod is at room temperature, rinse in cool water and pat dry. Gently place the cod in the heated olive oil. Remove the pan from the heat, transfer to the oven, and allow the cod to poach for exactly 25 minutes. Using a slotted spatula, remove the cod and transfer to a rack and gently blot dry."
- "Roast the tomatoes: increase oven temperature to 450° F. Place the tomatoes on a baking pan (covered with foil for easy clean up!) and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and black pepper. Roast until the skins of the tomatoes begin split open and they start to collapse and brown, about 10 minutes. If necessary, turn off oven and leave tomatoes inside with the door cracked until ready to plate."
