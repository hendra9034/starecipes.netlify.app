Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, brown sugar bbq chicken. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

This amazing Brown Sugar BBQ Chicken from Delish.com is the only way you&#39;ll want to eat chicken. Pulled chicken is made so easy in the slow-cooker and this version includes brown sugar, a little Italian dressing, and bourbon for a bit of smokiness. I did add alittle more of brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce to the sauce cause I thought it had to much flavor of the ketchup and a dash of white vinegar. I added small amounts of butter to each chicken piece (I used boneless chicken breast fillets).

##### The ingredients needed to make Brown sugar bbq chicken:

1. Take 5 piece thick cut chicken breast
1. Get 2 cup brown sugar
1. Get 1 large bottle of bbq sauce
1. Get 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar


I made a delicious sauce of bourbon, brown sugar, a little Italian dressing for some tang, and barbecue sauce of course for an insanely flavorful, super tender pulled chicken. My only gripe about this recipe is that I should have marinated this overnight so that the flavours can penetrate the chicken further. It is also not a very BBQ-y type of sauce (if you know what I mean) as it&#39;s mainly ketchup and sugar, and it doesn&#39;t really have the smoky flavour that most BBQ sauces have. Brown Sugar BBQ Chicken lets your slow cooker do allll the work.
