- " For the dough"
- " white strong bread flour"
- " Allison Easy Bake Yeast or any brand of easy bake yeast"
- " salt use more or less depending on preference"
- " sugar use more or less depending on preference"
- " soften unsalted butter"
- " warm water warm to the touch use more or less"
- " For garnish"
- " Unsalted softened butter brush over the hot bread so butter melts and seeds in"
- " Garlic finely minced optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using your fingertips rub in the butter until only fine ‘crumbs’ are left."
- "Add the water and mix with a fork. When the dough comes together tranfer it onto a lightly floured area. Tip: lightly flour dusted surface and knead for 10 minutes (or use the dough hook attachment on your mixer)."
- "Lightly grease the mixing bowl with some butter. Put the dough in and cover the bowl with a clean tea towel or cling film. Leave to prove in a warm area in your kitchen (i.e. the oven) until doubled in size (roughly 40 minutes to 50 minutes)."
- "Once dough has risen and doubled in size preheat the oven to 200 degrees under the grill setting. Preheat a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces. Shape into round balls and place on a lined baking tray. Take out one dough ball (keep remaining covered) and flatten it out into a circular shape. Transfer onto preheated baking tray and place straight into the oven."
- "The dough will slowly begin to rise. When brown spots form in the one side of the dough, turn over the bread and brown the other side."
- "Once both sides have browned, remove from the oven straightaway. Transfer onto a serving plate and immediately cover with a clean tea towel for a few minutes to prevent the breads drying up and becoming too crusty. While still warm brush with butter on top of the bread generously so that it can melt and seep in. This makes the bread very tasty. Additional toppings to add that go well with the melted butter is finely minced garlic (optional)."
- "Serve as an accompaniment for a barbecue to dip into such a hummus, or with homemade lamb kofta or as a wrap."
