- " Plain Flour"

- " Olive Oil"
- " Lukewarm water"
- " Salt"
- " Flaky Seasalt"
- " Rosemary"
- " Thyme"
- " Garlic Cloves Minced"
- " optional 12 tsp sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Check if you have active or instant yeast. If you have active you will need to wake it up. To do this use your lukewarm water. Dissolve the sugar in the water and add the yeast. Mix and leave to stand for 10 minutes, you will be able to see if the yeast is active as it will have foam on the surface. If you have instant yeast you don&#39;t need to do this and go to step 2."
- "Tip your flour into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the yeast (and water if you had to activate your yeast). Add the salt to the side of the bowl (don&#39;t add it on top of the yeast as it might kill it). Mix together."
- "Add the oil and water (if you skipped step 1) and gently bring together until you make a rough dough. Don&#39;t worry if the dough is very sticky, focaccia is quite a wet dough."
- "Tip the dough out onto a clean kitchen surface and knead for 10 minutes. If the dough is super wet a good way to do this is to use oil on your kitchen counter instead of flour to stop it sticking. To knead press the part of your hand where the wrist meets the hand and push away from you (see photo). This is a great way to work out those arms! ðŸ’ª"
- "You will see a difference in the dough after kneading. It will be a lot more elastic and stretchy. Form the dough into a ball and tip into an oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a wet tea-towel or clingfilm and leave to prove for 1 hour until doubled in size."
- "Line or oil a rectangle baking tray. Tip the dough onto the tray and then stretch it out to cover the whole tray. Cover again and leave to prove for another hour."
- "Heat the oven to gas mark 7 (200c). Use your fingertips to press dimples into the dough. Mix together 1 1/2 tbsp oil with 1tbsp water, minced garlic and the seasalt and drizzle onto the dough. Press the rosemary and thyme into the dimples in the dough."
- "Place in the oven and bake for 20 mins until golden. When it is cooked and still warm drizzle over 1-2 tbsp olive oil mixed with 1/2tbsp of water. Enjoy!!"
