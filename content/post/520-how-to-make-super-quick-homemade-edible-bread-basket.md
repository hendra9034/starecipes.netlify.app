recipeinstructions:
- "#Prepare_the_dough:  Add the yeast and sugar into 250 ml (1cup) of lukewarm water, mix and allow to stand for 10 minutes.  In a large bowl add the flour, salt, oil and the yeast mixture. Mix to form a medium soft dough."
- "Knead the dough on a floured surface for at least 5 minutes use electric mixer or by hand.  Place the dough in a lightly-greased bowl, cover and put in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size."
- "#Making_a_Basket  Prepare a mixing bowl that is oven safe. Preheat oven to 350 F. Cover the outside of the bowl with aluminium foil. Keep aside."
- "Transfer the risen dough to a floured surface. Flatten it and roll it into a large rectangle using a rolling pin. Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife cut the rectangle into 1/4 inch wide strips."
- "Take one strip and roll it back and forth with the palm of both hands to form a round rope. Repeat with 6 more strips. Lay the strips from one end of the bowl, over the top down the far side and to the end of the bowl. Flatten the top with the base of a cup. Roll another strip into a rope and start working your way in and out weaving a basket. Repeat until you cover the entire bowl."
- "Cut off the excess using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife. Do not tug on the rope before cutting it. In a separate bowl beat the egg with the water. Brush the egg wash over the surface of the basket. Ensure your strokes are along the long side ways and not up and own. This will create a weave pattern in case you leave marks."
- "Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.  Trace the top of the bowl on parchment paper.  Using three ropes make a braid to fit the circle. That is the decorative top."
- "Make another braid and lay it over the top of the inverted bowl brush with the egg wash. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  Put it all together with toothpicks. Your Edible Bread Basket is ready!"
