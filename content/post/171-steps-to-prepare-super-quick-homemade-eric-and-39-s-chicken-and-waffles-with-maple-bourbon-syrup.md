recipeinstructions:
- "Mix 1 quart of buttermilk and sriracha in a large bowl. Add the chicken and turn to coat the pieces. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours. I prefer to do it the evening prior and just leave them in overnight."
- "Mix everything for the dredge together in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper, and divide into 2 separate containers. You&#39;ll be doing a dry wet dry dredge prior to frying. Place the other half quart of buttermilk into a container as well."
- "Take the chicken out of the fridge and remove the pieces from the buttermilk mixture, placing them in a colander to drain off the excess liquid."

- "The size of the pot you use to fry will determine how much oil you use. I use a large spaghetti pot and put a few inches of oil into it, careful stay below filling it halfway. Toss in the oil additives and turn the heat on med high, getting the temperature to 350-360 degrees. The herbs and garlic will add flavor to the oil as it heats up."
- "Add the chicken pieces a few at a time. Do not overcrowd the pot as the temperature will drop. Cook thoroughly for about 20 minutes, rotating the pieces every few minutes until the chicken is golden brown. Move the finished chicken to a rack to drip and rest for 10 minutes"
- "FOR THE SYRUP: Mix the bourbon and maple syrup in a small saucepan and set to med high heat to cook off the alcohol. This should take about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until everything is combined. Set aside until warm or cool."
- "FOR THE WAFFLES: Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and cinnamon in a bowl."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff."
- "Mix the yolks, vegetable oil, milk, and vanilla extract in another bowl and then combine that with the flour mixture."
- "Fold the egg whites into the yolk and flour mixture. Once combined, cook them in the waffle iron of your choice."
