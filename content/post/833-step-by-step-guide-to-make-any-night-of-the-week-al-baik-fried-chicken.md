Though the restaurants also sell seafood, the franchise is iconic for its broasted (that is, a mix of pressure cooking and deep frying) chicken. If you&#39;ve had this amazing fried chicken either in Jeddah or Makkah or anywhere that has an Al-Baik fast-food chain, then am sure you could not possibly forget how fantastic it is. I tried many recipes but none came close, this one is the nearest to the real thing as I could get!!
