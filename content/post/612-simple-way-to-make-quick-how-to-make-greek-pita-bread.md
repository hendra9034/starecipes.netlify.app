recipeingredient:
- " Active Instant Dry Yeast"
- " Granulated Sugar"
- " Whole Milk Room Temperature"
- " Water"
- " Unbleached Allpurpose Flour"
- " Sea Salt"
- " Zaatar"
- " Greek Olive Oil 14g  More For Greasing"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, combine yeast, sugar, milk and water.   Stir to dissolve the yeast and sugar. Stir, stir, stir.   Set aside for 10 minutes or until becomes foamy.   In a large bowl, add flour, salt and za&#39;atar.   Mix to combine well. Mix, mix, mix."
- "Add olive oil into the yeast mixture.   Stir to combine well.   Add the yeast mixture into the flour mixture.   Combine the mixture well until it becomes a dough. You can do this by hand or a spatula.   Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour is kneaded into the dough, about 8 to 10 minutes."
- "The dough should be soft, subtle and tacky, but not sticky. It should pass the &#34;window-pane&#34; test.   If the dough is too dry, add in water, 1 TBSP at a time. If the dough is too sticky, add in flour, 1 TBSP at a time.   Form the dough into a ball.   Lightly grease the dough ball with olive oil.   Transfer back into the bowl."
- "Cover with cling film and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.   Lightly grease working surface with olive oil.   Transfer the dough onto a working surface.   Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces with a weight scale.   Form each piece into a dough ball."
- "While working with 1 dough ball, cover the rest of the dough ball with a damp lint-free kitchen towel.   Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a round disc with a diameter of 8 inches.   Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.   Place the shaped dough into the skillet."
- "Air pockets will start to form.   Once the bottom is lightly charred, flip and cook the other side until lightly charred.   Remove from heat and set aside until ready to use.   Repeat the steps for the remaining dough balls.   You can serve pita with gyros, souvlaki and even hummus. Or you can use them as a wrap or as a sandwich."
