<li>Bring a deep, heavy bottom pot no more than halfway filled with some high smoke point oil like canola or vegetable oil and let that heat up on medium heat to about 375F.</li>
<li>In a bowl, separate the egg white from the yolks and gently whisk to slightly foam the whites. Set aside. Reserve the yolks for scrambled eggs or for a dish like Carbonara.</li>
<li>In another bowl, combine the flour, breadcrumbs, and spices. Set aside.</li>
