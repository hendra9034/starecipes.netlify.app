<li>Prepare the ube dough. -  - In a large bowl, combine flour, ube powder, sugar, salt and yeast well. -  - <em>Do not add the yeast directly on the salt. It will kill the yeast.</em> -  - Gradually pour the water and coconut cream into the flour mixture while still mixing with a spatula. -  - Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour are kneaded into the dough, about 5 mins.</li>
<li>Transfer onto a lightly floured surface. -  - Add in the remaining half of the yudane. -  - Knead for about 5 mins until the yudane is fully incorporated. -  - Add in the butter. -  - Continue kneading for another 3 to 5 mins. -  - <em>Do take note that the yukane and butter has to be at room temperature.</em></li>
<li>The dough should be tacky, fluffy, smooth and it should pass the &quot;window-pane&quot; test. -  - If the dough is too dry, add in water, 1 TBSP at a time. If the dough is too sticky, add in flour, 1 TBSP at a time. -  - Lightly grease the bowl with some butter. -  - Transfer the dough back to the greased bowl. -  - Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 30 mins.</li>
<li>The 2 dough should slightly risen. -  - Punch down the dough and fold the top, sides and bottom to the center. -  - Flip, cover and let rise for 1 hr. -  - This process is sorta to ensure that the yeast is activated. -  - Both of the dough should be doubled in size. -  - <em>You can do a test by poking a floured finger into the dough. If it doesn't spring back, the yeast is activated properly and the dough is ready.</em></li>
<li>Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. -  - Form each dough into balls. -  - Cover with a lint-free kitchen towel and let rest for 15 mins. This is called the bench rest which allows the gluten to relax. -  - Grease bread pan with butter.</li>
<li>You will need a large working surface for the following steps.* -  - Roll ube dough into a large rectangle with the width almost the same as the length of the bread pan with a rolling pin. -  - Repeat the same for the pandan dough. -  - Swiftly place the ube dough on top of the pandan dough.</li>
<li>Stretch and adjust the width and length if needed. -  - Lightly roll with a rolling pin to adhere. -  - Roll the dough into a log like a Swiss roll or cinnamon buns. -  - Pinch the sims to seal tightly.</li>
<li>Transfer into the greased bread pan simmed side down. -  - Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 40 to 50 mins. -  - Preheat oven to 200 degree celsius or 400 fahrenheit. -  - The dough balls should rise about 1/2 inch away to the top of the loaf pan. -  - Close the lid and wack into the oven.</li>
<li>Bake for 40 to 1 hr or until the crust is golden brown. -  - Remove from the oven. -  - Immediately unmold onto a wire cooling rack. -  - Set aside to cool down completely before slicing.</li>
