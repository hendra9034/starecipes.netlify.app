<li>In a bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and several grinds of black pepper.</li>
<li>Pat the wings dry and add them to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle in a couple of pinches of salt and toss. Use a ladle to scoop in some of the flour mixture, then toss the wings again. Keep going until you run out of flour mixture and all the wings are nicely coated.</li>
<li>Shake the excess flour off the wings. Lay them in a single layer on a parchment covered cookie sheet. Put the wings uncovered in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Put a large, wide-bottomed frying pan on medium heat and fill it about 3/4 inch with veg oil. If you have a frying thermometer, use it to measure when the oil reaches 350 F. If, like me, you don't have one, take your best guess as to when the oil's hot enough.</li>
<li>Cook the wings in the oil in batches of 10 to 12 at a time. Flip them after 6 minutes to fry the other side. After about another 6 minutes they should be done. You'll know they're cooked when the bubbling of the oil slows down. Lay the cooked wings out on a paper towel lined plate. In between batches of wings, make the blue cheese dip.</li>
<li>Add the whipping cream to a small pot on medium-low heat. Once the cream has warmed up, whisk the blue cheese in a small chunk at a time until melted and smooth. Whisk in 4 to 5 dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Take the pot off the heat to cool.</li>
