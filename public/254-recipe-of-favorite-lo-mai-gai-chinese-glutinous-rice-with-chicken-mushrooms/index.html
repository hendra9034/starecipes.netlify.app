<h5 id="steps-to-make-lo-mai-gai---chinese-glutinous-rice-with-chicken-mushrooms">Steps to make Lo Mai Gai - Chinese Glutinous Rice with Chicken-Mushrooms:</h5>
<ol>
<li>A - Use any preferred part of the chicken (boneless). Cut into small bite-sizes. Marinate chicken with everything in A for at least an hour. You can also leave the chicken to marinate overnight &amp; use it the next day. We prefer overnight marination. Prepare everything the night before and refrigerate.</li>
<li>B - Soak dried mushrooms in hot water to soften. Keep this water used to soak mushrooms (optional), you can use some of it to cook the rice later. Then slice them thinly. Alternatively, these too, can be left soaked (in water) to soften overnight.</li>
<li>C - Soak glutinuos rice in tap water overnight. You can prepare the rest of the ingredients the night before too. Soak dried shrimps for 10mins or until they are soft. Drain the water, chop roughly and keep aside. Crush and mince garlics. Keep in the same small container with chopped shrimps.</li>
<li>Cooking and steaming LO MAI GAI - prepare the steamer, filling it with enough water and leave it to boil.</li>
<li>In the mean time, prepare üëâüèª C. Drain water from your rice. Then, Heat 4 tablespoons of cooking oil in a deep pan or a wok. Next, add garlic &amp; chopped shrimps. Saut√© over medium heat until aromatic. Add glutinuos rice &amp; the rest of the ingredients in C. Stir gently for 1-2 minutes; until everything is well-mixed. Add 1/2 cup of water. Stir for a minute or two. Turn off the heat. Add store-bought fried shallots to the rice. Stir again until well mixed. Remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Transfer this glutinous rice mixture to a steaming pan. Steam for 30-40 minutes.</li>
<li>Next, while waiting for the rice, prepare your filling. Heat 3 tablespoons of cooking oil in a wok. Next, add everything in A and B (thinly slice mushrooms). Simmer over medium low &amp; Cook until chicken is done. Add 1/4 cup of water if necessary. Stir well to avoid from sticking to the wok. Sauce will eventually thicken. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.</li>
<li>Once glutinous rice &amp; chicken filling are cooked, now it's time to assemble these two. Spoon desired amount of filling to your small steaming bowls, ramekins, aluminum tins, or anything small you can use for steaming. Place just enough chicken and mushrooms to cover the bottom of each steaming bowl. Add a tsp or two of sauce or gravy from the chicken. After that, top each bowl with cooked glutinous rice.</li>
