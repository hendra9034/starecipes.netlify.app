<ol>
<li>Prepare the cod: remove the cod from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour.</li>
<li>Prepare the saffron rice: place one pinch of saffron threads in a spice mortar and crush them with the pestle. Add the second pinch of saffron but don’t crush. Pour in 1/4 cup of hot water in the mortar and let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add minced onions and sauté until the onions begin to lightly brown.
