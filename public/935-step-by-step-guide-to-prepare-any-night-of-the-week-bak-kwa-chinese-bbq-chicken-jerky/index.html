<li>You can check out my previous recipe for the homemade Chinese 5 spice.</li>
<li>If you have a meat grinder, that's great. Grind the chicken thigh with your meat grinder.  - If not, you can use a blender or a food processor.  - Cut half of the chicken thigh into small pieces.  - Blend or process them up in batches.  - <em>Do not over blend or process them. Stop once the meat is ground up.</em></li>
<li>Transfer the ground chicken into a large mixing bowl.  - As for the remaining half of the chicken thigh, use a cleaver, chop into fine pieces. - Chop as finely as humanly can. - Transfer the chopped chicken into the same bowl as the ground chicken.</li>
<li>Add in the rest of the ingredients, except for the liquid smoke. - Mix to combine well. Mix, mix, mix.  - <em>A quick tip. Maltose syrup is difficult to work with at room temperature.

<li>Preheat oven to 180 degree celsius or 360 fahrenheit.  - Transfer about 2 heaped TBSP of the chicken onto a parchment paper.  - Place the other parchment paper on top of the chicken.  - Using a rolling pin, roll and spread out the chicken into a square as evenly as you can, to about 1/8 inch thick. - Remove the top parchment paper.</li>
<li>Do not discard, as you can use it for your second batch.*  - Transfer the chicken with the bottom parchment paper onto your baking tray.  - Wack into the oven and bake for 10 mins. - *(Optional) For some extra smoked flavors, you can add some smoking chips into a large bowl covered with aluminum foil.

<li>Mix 2 heaped TBSP of maltose and liquid smoke until well combined. - <em>Keep it warm on a double boiler for easier handling. If you are using honey or maple syrup, you can skip this step.</em> - Remove from the oven.  - Brush the chicken with the maltose mixture.</li>
<li>Wack into the oven and bake for another 10 mins. - Remove from the oven.  - Set oven to roast.  - Brush the chicken with more maltose mixture.</li>
<li>Wack into oven and roast for 5 mins.  - Remove from oven, flip and brush the chicken with maltose mixture.  - Wack into oven and bake for a final 5 mins or until the edge are lightly charred. - Remove from oven, set aside to rest and cool before serving. It will taste better the next day. - Repeat the process for the remaining chicken.</li>
<li>Smoked version: -  - I also included a smoked version with the help of my NordicWare's Stovetop Kettle Smoker. It is optional. But I would recommend smoking these Bak Kwa. Yes, it does lack texture but sure makes up for flavors. And I mean, complex layers of flavors.</li>
<li>For the smoking method. - <em>If you are using this smoked method, replace smoked salt with sea salt.</em> - If you have a smoker, I would highly recommend smoking the chicken jerky. Although it lacks texture, it makes up for flavors. - I am using NordicWare's Stovetop Kettle Smoker.</li>
<li>Follow the procedures as per instructed manual. - After the chicken had been marinated, transfer about 2 heaped TBSP of the chicken onto a parchment paper.  - Place the other parchment paper on top of the chicken.  - Using a rolling pin, roll and spread out the chicken into a circle (smaller than the kettle smoker), as evenly as you can, to about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
<li>Remove the top parchment paper.  - <em>Do not discard, as you can use it for your second batch.</em>  - <em>Keep maltose warm on a double boiler for easier handling. If you are using honey or maple syrup, you can skip this step.</em> - Smoke for 15 mins, remove the cover, brush with the maltose.</li>
<li>Cover and smoke for another 15 mins. - Remove cover, flip and brush with the maltose. - Cover and smoke for a final 10 or 15 mins or until the edges are lightly charred. - <em>I would suggest, taking the temperature higher than stated in the instruction manual, cos we want those charred edges.</em> - Remove from smoker, set aside to rest and cool before serving. It will taste better the next day. - Repeat the process for the remaining chicken.</li>
