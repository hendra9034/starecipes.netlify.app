<ol>
<li>Begin your roast by searing it on high in a slight amount of oil on all sides until browned.</li>
<li>Add everything in the roast section and cover tightly. Simmer for 2 hours or until it's easily shredded apart with forks. Flip roast occasionally.</li>
<li>Rinse your chicken breasts and pat dry. Create your brine by adding everything in the brine section in 2 cups hot water. Mix until fully dissolved and cooled. Add ice and ice water and cooled brine together in a gallon sized Ziplock Bag. Add chicken. Place in fridge for 1+ hours. Massage and turn bag occasionally.</li>
<li>Pull your chicken and 2 by 2 - add to your second clean Ziplock Bag. With a heavy mallet - beat chicken to equal thicknesses.</li>
<li>Trim any fat or anything unsightly. Lightly oil chicken breasts.</li>
<li>Clean, oil and high heat your grill. Preheat grill for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Grill chicken for 3 minutes on each side with your grill covered. Grill until you achieve a slight char.</li>
<li>Turn heat to medium and grill breasts on indirect heat [away from direct flames] for 7 to 10 minutes. Depending upon the thickness of your chicken breasts. Continually flip and coat with BBQ Sauce. Get ready for your grill to look a complete disaster!</li>
<li>Shuck corn and clean off fibers. Add corn to a large pot and add enough water to cover them. Add 1 cup whole milk and 1 cube butter. Bring to a boil. Cover and boil for 7 to 10 minutes depending upon size. Watch closely as the milk addition WILL cause your pot to foam over.</li>
<li>Allow chicken to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Slice your BBQ chicken into strips.</li>
<li>Pull your roast, shread with forks and drain. Reserve fluids for recipes later in the week.</li>
<li>Place shreaded meat into a large bowl and mix in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce to your liking. Or, leave it naked and allow your guests to drizzle BBQ sauce over their sandwiches.</li>
<li>Grill or pan sear your buns with butter and a light sprinkle of garlic and onion powder.</li>
<li>Crispy grilled garlic buns.</li>
