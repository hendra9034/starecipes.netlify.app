<li>A - Use any preferred part of the chicken (boneless). Cut into small bite-sizes. Marinate chicken with everything in A for at least an hour. You can also leave the chicken to marinate overnight &amp; use it the next day. We prefer overnight marination. Prepare everything the night before and refrigerate.</li>

Drain the water, chop roughly and keep aside. Crush and mince garlics. Keep in the same small container with chopped shrimps.</li>
<li>Cooking and steaming LO MAI GAI - prepare the steamer, filling it with enough water and leave it to boil.</li>
