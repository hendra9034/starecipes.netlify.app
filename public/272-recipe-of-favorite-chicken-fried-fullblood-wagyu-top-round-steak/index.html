Repeat with the remaining steaks, and place the breaded steaks on the plate – do not stack the steaks on top of each other.Heat the grapeseed oil in a large stainless steel sauté pan over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add the butter to the pan. When the butter starts to sizzle, it’s ready for the breaded steak. (NOTE: It should not brown right away. If it does, the fire/heat is too hot.) Cook 3 pieces of breaded steak at a time for around 2 minutes per side. Cook until each side is golden brown.Remove the cooked Fullblood Wagyu steaks to a plate lined with paper towels. Keep the chicken fried steaks warm by covering them lightly with a foil sheet. Repeat the process until all of the steaks are cooked.</li>

Wipe out the skillet, and return it to the stove over medium heat.Add 1/4 cup of the fat back to the skillet. Add 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet as well, and allow it to heat up.When the fat is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over it.
